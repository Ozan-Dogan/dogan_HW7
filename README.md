a. This project features a multi-page web form designed to collect feedback from students at the University of Iowa, focusing on their hometown, impressions of their major, and duration of study, aimed at enhancing the university experience.

b. My form follows best practices by ensuring a logical progression across multiple pages, reducing user fatigue and improving completion rates. We utilized appropriate form elements—input boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns—to make the form intuitive. Tooltips provide users with information on how to complete fields correctly, and real-time validation prevents errors before submission, enhancing the overall user experience.

c. I prioritized accessibility by using semantic HTML, ensuring that the form is navigable with a keyboard and readable by screen readers. This approach ensures our form is usable by all and aligns with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for web accessibility.
